# LEGOshelf
**LEGOshelf** is a project built with Next.js, designed to help LEGO enthusiasts (my six-and-a-half-years-old son) manage their LEGO collections easily. Inspired by the goal of creating a fun and simple platform for a young audience, this application allows users to look up LEGO sets and will eventually enable them to build a personalized digital LEGO library.
